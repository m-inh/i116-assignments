All other symbols should pass through encryption and decryption unaffected. The shifting of a symbol should wrap around its set. \n","\n","For example:\n","- The symbol ‚Äúa‚Äù shifted -1 should become ‚Äúz.‚Äù \n","- The symbol ‚Äú9‚Äù shifted +1 should become ‚Äú0.‚Äù \n","- The symbol ‚ÄúZ‚Äù shifted +2 should become ‚ÄúB.‚Äù \n","\n","## Encode Program\n","\n","The first program should encode text. It should prompt for one word (string) at a time, encode it, and print out the encoded version. This should continue until the single symbol ‚Äú.‚Äù is given as input, which should terminate the program. The first program must accept a single command line argument defining the shift delta. The value of delta must be an integer between -9 and +9, inclusive.\n","\n","## Decode Program\n","\n","The second program should decode encrypted text. It should be unaware of the value of delta used to encode the text. Instead, it must figure out the value of delta by trying to decrypt using all possible values for delta and examining the resulting text. \n","\n","## Note\n","\n","To examine the result, the program must use the dictionary stored in the linux.words file (usually found in /usr/share/dict, depending on your system‚Äôs installation of ispell). It should compare every potential decrypted word with the dictionary, looking for a match. Whichever value for delta produces the most matches with words in the dictionary should be assumed to be the correct value for delta. The program should print out the decrypted text using that value of delta (and it should not print out anything else). \n","\n","Assume that the message being encrypted or decrypted consists of fewer than 100 words, and that no word is longer than 30 characters.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZwgYZQg-hkWp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import math\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lqXgl45D3ZJ8","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["\"\"\"Define global variables here\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","upper_case_alphabet = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n","lower_case_alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n","numbers = \"0123456789\"\n","\n","mini_dict = [\"go\", \"python\", \"javascript\"]\n","\n","char_maps = [upper_case_alphabet, lower_case_alphabet, numbers]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PNLP-jeCUisQ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["class Character:\n","  \"\"\"Represent a character in Latin alphabet\n","\n","  Attributes\n","  ----------\n","  char: Str\n","    a string has only one character\n","  \"\"\"\n","  def __init__(self, char):\n","    self.char = char\n","    self.code = -1\n","    self.map_index = -1\n","    for i in range(len(char_maps)):\n","      for c in char_maps[i]:\n","        if (c == char):\n","          self.map_index = i\n","          self.code = char_maps[i].index(c)\n","          break\n","\n","  def shift(self, n):\n","    \"\"\"The shifting of a symbol wrap around its set. \n","\n","      For example, the symbol ‚Äúa‚Äù shifted -1 should become ‚Äúz.‚Äù \n","      The symbol ‚Äú9‚Äù shifted +1 should become ‚Äú0.‚Äù\n","      The symbol ‚ÄúZ‚Äù shifted +2 should become ‚ÄúB.‚Äù \n","\n","    Only letter (upper- and lowercase) and numeric (0‚Äì9) symbols is affected\n","    \n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    n: Int\n","      Number of step needs to be shifted\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    shifted_char: Character\n","      New character after be shifted\n","    \"\"\"\n","    assert -9 <= n <= 9\n","\n","    if (self.map_index == -1):\n","      return self\n","\n","    char_map = char_maps[self.map_index]\n","    map_size = len(char_map)\n","    new_index = n + self.code\n","    \n","    if (new_index >= map_size):\n","      new_index = new_index -
